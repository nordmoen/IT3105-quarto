\section{Future work}\label{future work}
Our implementation is far from perfect and there are some improvements
that we came up with that we did not have time to implement. Below
are a few of the thoughts that we had for further improvements.

\subsection{Guaranteed losses}
There are cases of guaranteed losses that we do not currently detect, for 
instance: a 3-piece line of circles and one with tall pieces, with only 
circular and tall pieces remaining to be placed(see figure \ref{fig:gloss2}).

	our algorithm}
